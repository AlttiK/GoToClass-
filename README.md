# Go To Class!
College students skip class all the time. Why not make it a competition between friends on who has the best attendance? Go To Class! is the class attendance leaderboard for your entire friend group.

## Inspiration
We are always skipping class for no reason, even though we know we should not.

## What it does
A weekly leaderboard with your friends scoring your class attendance, studying, etc.

## How we built it
We used Expo React Native for the app and a Firebase server for the backend. 

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the server set up and actually working with logins and inputs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Debugging lots of server issues with authentication. 
Learning a lot of new React Native packages.

## What we learned
A lot about the nuances with database setup design, as well as app project layout and efficiency.

## What's next for Go To Class!
Build off of the MVP and add the ability to sabotage friends if they skip class, multipliers for streaks, weekly rewards, and real location tracking to enforce attendance.
